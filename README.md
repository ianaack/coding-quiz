# JavaScript Coding Quiz

## A web application quiz on JavaScript

This JavaScript project is a timed quiz used to test students knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals.

When the student is ready, they click the START button and a timer for the quiz starts counting down.

If the student answers correctly they get 5 points added to their score. However, if they answer incorrectly 10 seconds is deducted from the timer.

When all the questions have been answered, or the timer reaches 0, the game is over.

Each student is then able to submit their initials to be displayed on a high score leaderboard!
